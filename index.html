        <p class="lead mb-5">Dr. Laurie Hoke has devoted her career to the health and well-being of school age children,
          working tirelessly to support their social emotional and academic health and advise their families on ways to
          support their needs. With a Doctorate Degree in Educational Psychology and a Master’s Degree in school
          psychology, both from Loyola University of Chicago Dr. Hoke has vast knowledge and experience with children’s
          behavior, social, emotional and educational development.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-5">Dr. Hoke has over 23 years as a school psychologist and 5 years as a special education administrator.
          Throughout her tenure working in education, Dr. Hoke has worked with students and their families to ensure
          that families have a full understanding of the steps to take to obtain the necessary supports for their
          children, the assessment process and what takes place at meetings for their children.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-5">Dr. Hoke has been a resource for families nation-wide. Parents seek out Dr. Hoke to provide guidance when
          there is a support their child is not getting, when the school contacts parents to invite them in for meetings
          and when parents of students with severe disabilities require additional supports or placements throughout
          their education. Dr. Hoke provides parents with clear, distinct information that will assist them in
          navigating the process of obtaining supports for their children in school as well as understanding their
          rights in working with the school when a need is identified by the teacher.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-5">Dr. Hoke strives to educate and coach parents so that they attend meetings prepared and knowing what they are
          entitled to, as well as what questions to ask. Her expertise in the facilitation of such meetings in the
          school setting makes her an excellent resource for families as they prepare to deal with the schools’
          administration on their child’s behalf. Laurie’s insights into this process afford parents the important
          ability to educate themselves before attending a meeting where decisions may be made regarding the education
          of their child. This ability enhances the success of parents working in conjunction with the school system to
          advocate for the supports their child needs.</p>

        <p>"Dr. Laurie Hoke has always been readily available to answer questions and give step-by-step guidance when
          needed. She is well versed in theory, and has a rare combination of sensitivity and practicality. Experienced
          and highly skilled, Dr. Hoke compassionately supported myself and my daughter through the educational process
          so that we had the best possible outcome."

        <br><br>
        <p class="mb-0">"As a special education teacher, I had the pleasure of working with Laurie during the diagnosis
          phase for my students. Laurie does a great job explaining the diagnostic results to parents in terms that are
          understandable to all. In addition, Laurie does a great job making all students feel comfortable during
          testing to ensure that a true score is achieved. In my practice as a BCBA, Laurie has also provided the family
          I work with support for the parent attending an IEP meeting and requesting services. Laurie educated the
          family on their rights, guided them regarding expectations and questions to ask at their child’s meeting, and
          helped them find the best supports for their son."
