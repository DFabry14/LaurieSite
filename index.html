        <p class="lead mb-5">Dr. Laurie Hoke has devoted her career to the health and well being of school age children;
          she has worked tirelessly to support their social, emotional and academic needs. With over 23 years experience
          as a practicing School Psychologist and 5 years as a Special Education Administrator, she has extensive
          knowledge of children’s behavioral, social, emotional, and educational development.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-5">Dr. Hoke holds a Doctorate in Educational Psychology, and a Master of Education in School
          Psychology, both earned at Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois. Her Bachelor of Arts in School Psychology
          was earned at Michigan State University.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-5">Throughout her tenure working in education, Dr. Hoke has interacted with students and their
          families to ensure that they have a full understanding of the total process involved with securing the best
          possible support for each individual child. This includes the assessment process, what to expect at school
          meetings, and your rights as parents.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-5">Dr. Hoke has been a resource for families nation-wide. For years, parents have sought her
          guidance and expertise when they are dealing with difficult issues regarding their children’s needs at school.
          Whether it’s a support the child is not getting, or the school is requesting a special meeting, she has
          been an invaluable asset for parents. When students with severe disabilities require additional services
          and/or placement, she provides parents with clear, distinct information that will assist them in
          navigating this process.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-5">Dr. Hoke strives to advise and coach parents so when they attend school meetings, they are
          prepared with the appropriate questions, and knowledge of their child’s entitlements. Her expertise in
          the facilitation of such school meetings over many years makes her an excellent resource for parents.</p>

        <p>"Dr. Laurie Hoke has always been readily available to answer questions and give step-by-step guidance when
          needed. She is well versed in theory, and has a rare combination of sensitivity and practicality. Experienced
          and highly skilled, Dr. Hoke compassionately supported myself and my daughter through the educational process
          so that we had the best possible outcome."

        <p class="mb-0">"As a special education teacher, I had the pleasure of working with Laurie during the diagnosis
          phase for my students. Laurie does a great job explaining the diagnostic results to parents in terms that are
          understandable to all. In addition, Laurie does a great job making all students feel comfortable during
          testing to ensure that a true score is achieved. In my practice as a BCBA, Laurie has also provided the family
          I work with support for the parent attending an IEP meeting and requesting services. Laurie educated the
          family on their rights, guided them regarding expectations and questions to ask at their child’s meeting, and
          helped them find the best supports for their son."
